Mashathon 2014 Voice Of People
MASHATHON SUBMISSION

VOICE OF PEOPLE APP

Overview:
Voice of People App is all about knowing the sentiments of the people in the company about any topic. The admins of the company can utilize this light weight app to know any opinion/feedback about any question they would like to ask to their people.
The advantage of this app is that it uses the innovative API from HP Idol On Demand to give very quickly, a high level idea of, what people in the organization are currently thinking about the new change that has happened for which the feedback was requested. However apart from the overall sentiment, the app goes into user level details recording each and every feedback that people gave on this application and provides an easy access to those using Google Spreadsheets. The app gives access to only the employees of the configured domain. To post the question for gathering feedback, the access is  given only to Super Admins of the domain.
Quick Demo:
I ll now show a quick demo of the app.

APIs Used:
The wheel gave me three options – Google, Amazon and Pick Any.
My Picks -  Google + HP Idol On Demand.
Google Admin SDK, Google Spreadsheets to save the data in the sheet, Google Login
HP Idol On Demand Sentiment Analysis API
Summarizing:
1.	In the summary, I would like to map this application to the scorecard requirements of the Mashathon. This is quite a unique and innovative way of quickly knowing the sentiments of the people in the company. This App uses the Innovative API from HP Idol On Demand Sentiment Analysis API to quickly show the overall sentiments about any topic. 
2.	Utilizes two APIs as explained above as per the mashathon rules.
3.	Uses Google Cloud Platform – Google App Engine, to take advantage of google datastore entiries and efficient queries.
4.	All in all this is a basic version of the app which is complete by itself and is ready to be used in the real world. The app has lots of enhancements that can be done but for a basic version its very easy and complete.
